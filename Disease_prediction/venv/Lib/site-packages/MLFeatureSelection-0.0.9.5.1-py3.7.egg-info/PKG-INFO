        General features selection based on certain machine learning algorithm
        and evaluation methods
        
        **Divesity, Flexible and Easy to use**
        
        More features selection method will be included in the future!
        
        Quick Installation
        ------------------
        
        .. code:: python
        
            pip3 install MLFeatureSelection
        
        Modulus in version 0.0.9.5
        --------------------------
        
        -  Modulus for selecting features based on greedy algorithm (from
           MLFeatureSelection import sequence\_selection)
        
        -  Modulus for removing features based on features importance (from
           MLFeatureSelection import importance\_selection)
        
        -  Modulus for removing features based on correlation coefficient (from
           MLFeatureSelection import coherence\_selection)
        
        -  Modulus for reading the features combination from log file (from
           MLFeatureSelection.tools import readlog)
