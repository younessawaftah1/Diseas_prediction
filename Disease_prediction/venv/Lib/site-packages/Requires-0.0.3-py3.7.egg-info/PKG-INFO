        An assertion test generator for Python meant for use with nose.py or
        something that uses ``assert`` as a method for running tests. It uses
        function chaining to achieve very high readability and make BDD less
        tedious.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from requires.expect import expect
        
            expect([]).to.be.a(list)
            expect([]).to.be.empty()
        
            expect(2).to.be.within(1,3)
            expect(list).to.have.method('append')

        Note
        ----
        
        Requires is still work-in-progress and it's API may change at anytime.
        However the changes shouldn't be overly drastic. Once I have settled
        down to an API spec I will upload the package to PyPI and the changes
        should then be either bugfixes or mainly additions and optimizations.
        
        You can now download the package with PIP, and it is available under
        the name ``Requires``. Feel free to require it within any of your
        unit test suites. You can easily install the package with the following
        command::
        
            $ pip install Requires

        Overview
        --------
        
        Requires uses a chainable object in order to create tests that are
        really concise and readable. It is meant for use in the BDD style,
        i.e.:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from requires.expect import expect
            from library import function
        
            res, err = function(0)
            expect(err).to.Not.exist()
            expect(res).to.be.equal(1)
